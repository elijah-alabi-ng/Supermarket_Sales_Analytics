- Analyze Sales Performance – Determine the best-selling product categories and sub-categories.
- Evaluate Profitability – Identify the most and least profitable products to optimize pricing and inventory strategies.
- Assess Discount Impact – Understand how discounting affects sales and profit margins.
- Provide Actionable Recommendations – Suggest improvements in marketing focus, pricing adjustments, and discount strategies.
